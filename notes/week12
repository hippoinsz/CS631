Lecture 12
================

Before class
----------------
I read the slites and watch the viedos on the Youtube.

This lecture talks about locking and non-blocking I/O.
Non-blocking I/O lets us issue an I/O operation and not have it block forever. If the operation cannot be completed, return is made immediately with an error noting that the operating would have blocked (EWOULDBLOCK or EAGAIN).

After class
----------------
syslog:
De-facto standard for message logging on Unix systems since the 1980s.
Various newer versions with many new features (TCP, TLS, logging to a database or a filter, â€¦) available, e.g., syslog-ng, rsyslog.
