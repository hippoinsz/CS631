Lecture 9
================

Before class
----------------
In this segment, I learn the socket. How can we create a server through progrem.
The different bettween the ipv4 and ipv6. How do we create a listen of a port.

After class
----------------
The steps to create a server:
1. create socket using socket(2)
2. attach to a socket using bind(2)
3. both processes need to agree on the name to use
4. these files are only used for rendezvous, not for message delivery
5. sockets are represented as file descriptors, so you can use read(2) and write(2)
6. dedicated system calls like recv(2) and send(2) etc. offer specific functionality
7. after communication, sockets must be removed using unlink(2)
