Lecture 13
===============

Before class
---------------
I carefully read the slides on the webside.
I wathc the videoes of this lecture.

The nature of UNIX being a multitasking multiuser OS implies the need for user privileges, file permissions, process ownership and management of all finite resources.

I finish part of the group project.

After class
----------------
ACLs are stored as Extended Attributes and thus require support of the file system.
Ordering of ACLs may be relevant â€” experiment with different users and groups to
verify the impact of the order.
