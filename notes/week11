Lecture 11
=================

Before class
-----------------
This time I learn how our code compile to an executable file. And the links between the codes. And I also know the shared libraries.

After class
-----------------
Static libraries let you build statically linked executables containing all the code needed to run the program.
Dynamic libraries let you define which code should be pulled in at execution time.
The behavior of dynamically linked executables can be influenced by changing the dynamic library without requiring the executable to be re-compiled or re-linked.
