Lecture 6
==============

Before class
--------------
I carefully read the slites and watch the viedos on the Youtube.

I knows the lays of a process memory. And how a program startup and terminate.
Also learning how to control a process through pid.

After class
-------------
After creating a new process via fork(2), the parent process can wait(2) for the child process to reap its exit status and resource utilization; failure to do so will create a zombie process until the parent is terminated, at which point init will reap it.
