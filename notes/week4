Lecture 4
=================

Before class:
-----------------
I carefully read the course website and syllabus.
I watch the videoes of the this lecture.

I learn that there are seven file styles, such as normal file, directory, links,pipe and so on.

And also learn different times of the file, modify time, create time and last data access time

After class:
-----------------
Important take-away:
To move a file within a single filesystem, we can just ”move” the directory entry (actually done by creating a new entry, and deleting the old one).
