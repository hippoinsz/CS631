Lecture 7
==============

Before class
--------------
From the slides and videos, I learn that signals can be accept, ignore, catch and block. And some signal cannot be ignored.

After class
--------------
Signals are notifications of asynchronous events; delivery is similar to a hardware interrupt (current context is saved, a new context is built).
