Lecture 2
==============

Before class
--------------
I read the slites and watch the viedos on the Youtube.

The Unix use file descriptos to operate the files. We can use open() an close() to open and close a file. read(2) is to read the file, write(2) is write something into the file and lseek(2) is to find a offset of the file.

After class
--------------
Important take-away:
- Always close the fd after open a file. Because it make cause disk space full since the file is not closed, the space occupied by the original file will not be released.
